title: Kismet Coffee & Bloom Fulfills its Destiny in Cedar Rapids


Paragraphs: 

“Both coffee and flowers go beyond necessity, and lend themselves to simpler pleasures that can make daily life a more vibrant experience,” Gonlubol told Daily Coffee News. “At Kismet, we try to provide an accessible kind of luxury for our guests.”
The 1,200-square-foot downtown shop is split between two floors, with the coffee operation on the entry level. Bright pastels with dark accent colors surround locally scouted vintage furniture and fixtures. Artwork hung throughout the space, including a nook featuring multiple Warhol prints, reflects Gonlubol’s background in fine and public art.
With a relatively cozy interior, the shop layout encourages conversation about the processes involved both coffee and flower production.
“Knowing where flowers come from and the journey they take from farm to vase is important and meaningful to many of our guests,” said Gonlubol, noting the similarity to coffee’s farm-to-cup journey.
Kasner said the multiroaster program allows for an array of roast profiles and coffee flavors from which guests can discover their own tastes. While the seeds of an in-house roasting program have yet to be formally planted, it’s definitely in the Kismet business almanac.
Said Kasner, “Until then, we’re looking forward to opening our books for small events, welcoming new faces and further cultivating community around flowers and coffee.”

title: Breakers Coffee + Wine is Focused on Food, Flights and Farms in San Diego


Paragraphs: 

Named for the act of breaking the crust with a spoon while cupping a coffee, Breakers echoes the blue of the Diedrich machine through blue slate pillars and blue/green hues mixed with shades of brown in a multi-layered, acid-stained concrete floor.
“The concept is to create a seamless experience of coffee and wine,” said Rosa. “They have so much in common: how terroir, sun and farming influence character; pruning and processing methods; cuppings and flights; caffeine and alcohol; the list goes on.”
“Our priority is simply to be great storytellers,” Rosa told Daily Coffee News. “We get these coffee beans at the tail end of a long journey, and it’s therefore our duty to share that journey. Being a coffee grower myself, I know how much work goes into caring for these trees, and how holding high standards relate to high quality in the cup. These farmers should be celebrated, and the stories told.”
The coffees soon to come from Bluetail Coffee Grove will carry some stories of their own.
For wind protection and shade, the coffee is surrounded by avocado trees and fan palms, with mango trees soon to be planted inside the grove, as well.
The Bluetail Coffee Grove farm, which was first planted with coffee trees in 2019.
“We have so many great plans for Breakers and Bluetail — coffee and wine memberships, food pairings, [a] rotating menu of single origin coffees and wines, and the most important, our very own San Diego-grown coffee,” said Rosa. “Our goal is to share California grown coffee with the world, one cup at a time.”
I am looking forward to visiting this roastery, coffee and wine bar – looks like a good vibe.

title: Ypsilanti-Born Hyperion Coffee Co. Opens in Ann Arbor


Paragraphs: 

“Our goal since opening is to represent the coffee producers’ intentions with how we serve our coffee,” Hyperion Coffee Co-Owner Eric Mullins said of the new shop. “So the menu is single-origin drip coffees brewed on a Fetco, espresso drinks prepared on a La Marzocco Linea PB ABR and Mahlkonig grind-by-weight grinders. [We] weigh everything all of the time.”
Syrups and other drink ingredients are made in house or carefully sourced to include only natural ingredients, while the focus remains on clean brewed coffee roasted just down the road in Ypsilanti.
Said Mullins, “It’s our opinion that, if done right, batch brew is by far the best and most consistent method to brew amazing coffee, as opposed to pour overs and alt brewing methods.”
Beyond the Ann Arbor cafe, the pandemic era has ushered in plenty of change for Hyperion, according to Mullins. The company, whose founders have deep experience in both coffee and coffee machinery, relocated the roastery to accommodate additional wholesale business, upgraded the equipment at its Ypsilanti shop, and transitioned to offer employees health insurance and benefits packages, according to Mullins.

title: Dozer Coffee Awakens at the HOMES Campus in Ann Arbor


Paragraphs: 

HOMES production brewing (left), across the courtyard from the HOMES Can Shop, Smooj Lab, art gallery and Dozer coffee space.
HOMES, whose name is an acronym representing the five Great Lakes, purchased the industrial property after opening its original brewpub near Vet’s park in 2017. The coffee component began to pick up steam through a serendipitous meeting in 2018 with Adam Rizzo, who who happened to be meeting friends at the brewpub.
Under the watch of Dozer Cafe Manager Kyle Klobucar, those coffees make their way to a manual pourover bar or to a Curtis G4 Twin batch brewer supported by a Mahlkönig EK43.
Cold coffee offerings follow flash chilling and nitrogen treatment. A 3-group Linea PB AV machine flanked by Mazzer Robur S and Kony S grinders support the espresso-based menu.
Alongside coffees, guests are offered rotating popup and experimental food menus reflecting the efforts of HOMES Campus Head Chef Nick Muscato, Head Pastry Chef Jennifer Zimmer and Pastry Sous Chef Dante Kemble. The day’s donut offerings are given a glamorous reflective glass display at the counter.
Dozer will continue to benefit from HOMES’ ongoing food-focused projects, according to Lauzon, which like coffee and beer, highlight the elements of production.
